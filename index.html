              The Museum of Science (MoS) is a science museum and indoor zoo in
              Boston, Massachusetts, located in Science Park, a plot of land
              spanning the Charles River. Along with over 700 interactive
              exhibits, the museum features a number of live presentations
              throughout the building every day, along with shows at the Charles
              Hayden Planetarium and the Mugar Omni Theater, the only domed IMAX
              screen in New England. The museum is also an accredited member of
              the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and is home to over
              100 animals, many of which have been rescued and rehabilitated
              from various dangerous situations.
